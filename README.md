# 🎬 myFlix-Angular-client

https://cinemahub22.netlify.app/welcome

Hi there! 👋  
This is the **Angular frontend** for my movie database project, `myFlix`. It's a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to browse a collection of movies, manage their favourites, and update their profile — all connected to a custom-built REST API I developed.

This client was built as part of my learning journey with Angular, and it demonstrates the core concepts of component-driven development, Angular Material design, and integration with external APIs.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- ✅ Register new users
- ✅ Authenticate existing users
- ✅ Browse all movies in the catalogue
- ✅ View genre & director info
- ✅ Add/remove favourites
- ✅ Update or delete your profile

Everything is powered by Angular + TypeScript on the frontend and communicates with a Node.js/Express backend connected to MongoDB.

🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

This project was part of my full-stack development studies and my commitment to understanding Angular beyond tutorials. It pushed me to think in components, manage state reactively, and implement a clean UI with Material Design.
